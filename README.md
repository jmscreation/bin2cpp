# Bin 2 CPP
 Convert binary files into *.cpp files instantly.

 This branch is currently a work in progress. This branch will add encryption into the resource files, along with built-in decryption. The library used for decryption will currently rely on LibTomCrypt.

# Build
Either customize your build toolchain to properly build all *.cpp files and link against the necessary libraries required, or run `deps -update` and then run the build.bat script.
